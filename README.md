# Pyschic-ePaper
## Changeable Doctor Who 'psychic paper' using the power of ePaper/eInk

In the Sci-Fi TV show Doctor Who, psychic paper is a blank piece of paper nestled in an ID wallet, used by the holder to psychically show IDs and credentials.

While we're severely lacking working psychic paper in the real world, we can at least make Psychic ePaper: updatable, changeable IDs and credentials using the power of e-ink/e-paper!

Powered by Adafruit's [ItsyBitsy nRF52840 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4481) and [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org), the Psychic ePaper is Bluetooth LE compatible and updatable from a phone, tablet, or computer running Adafruit's Bluefruit Connect apps.
